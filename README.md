# 📚 Book Store – A Modern React-Based Online Bookstore

**Book Store** is a responsive and fully interactive web application built from scratch using React. It's designed as a showcase project to reflect my growing expertise in front-end development, combining real-world functionality with thoughtful UI/UX design.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Search & Filter** books by genre and price
- 🛒 **Shopping Cart** functionality with add, remove, and checkout
- 📱 Fully **responsive** layout using Flexbox, CSS Grid, Bootstrap, and media queries
- ⚡️ **Performance optimization** via lazy loading, `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`
- 🎨 Smooth **animations and interactions** using:
  - Framer Motion
  - Swiper.js
  - React toastify
  - React spinners
  - Bootstrap

## 💡 Smart Book Recommendation (Beta)
A unique feature that suggests 3 books based on the user's answers to a short quiz.  
Currently implemented with predefined logic, but planned for future enhancement using an AI-based backend and natural language analysis via API.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- React, Redux, Context API, React Router
- Framer Motion, Swiper.js, React toastify

## WebSites will be helpful I used :
- Coolors, Google Fonts, Get Emoji ,UIVerse.io


This project reflects my commitment to learning and building real, useful interfaces with scalable design and modern front-end practices.  
I'd love to hear your feedback or ideas for future improvements!
